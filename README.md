A script for generating Nitrogen-Doped structures by changing concentration of Nitrogen in the structure.

Abstract:
"Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance because it is the cathodic reaction of a fuel cell and also the rate determining step due to the accumulative four electron transfer pathway. Although Pt (Platinum) is the most efficient catalyst for ORR, its high cost and low cost hinders its wide application. Researchers are motivated to replace Pt with more abundant and cheaper materials. Nitrogen-doped carbon has been proved to be a promising material for achieving that. However, the activity of N doped carbon still underperforms that of Pt. In this work, we would like to study the effect of N doping concentration and surface functionalization on the activity of N doped carbon. Machine learning approach is useful to analyze huge amount of possibilities of N doping structures and surface functionalizations. Moreover, machine learning approach also reduces the costs required to perform first-principles DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations by selectively performing calcuations on only promising structures. Different algorithms such as neural network, gradient-boosted regression are tested. By combining machine learning with first-principles DFT calculations, we aim to better understand how tuning N doping concentration and surface functionalization could help increase the activity of N doped carbon."
